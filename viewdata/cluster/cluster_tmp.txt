13456        lean  lean.v  Thanks , one thing I should have pointed out , I 'm not going to be running this bike hard , or on a track , or anything like that , it will probably only get taken out a couple of times a summer like on his birthday , it 's one day before mine and he was shot 3 days before them , I 'm not looking for performance upgrades so much as advice like the replacement of the chain guide like you mentioned , checking chains and keeping the fluids up is standard maintenance and I 've got all that covered from 37 years of being a mechanic , it 's maintenance advice for a CBR929 RR in particular , ie chain guide replacement everytime a new chain is put on is the kind of advice I 'm looking for , this bike is not going to be run hard or used for racing street or track , I 've got other bikes for that , it 's going to be treated like a vehicle you would see on Jay Lenos Garage or something similar , strictly a collectors piece now , this bike means more to me than I can describe and I cringe at the very thought of it getting even a little scratch on it so needless to say as long as it 's in my possession it will never be anywhere near it 's redline or get run anywhere near it 's potential , I know that 's not what they 're made for , god knows I have run most everything I own to where it 's amazing that they do n't all have a connecting rod sticking out of their cases but this one is a different story , is there anything about these engines running so ** lean ** that it shortens engine life like on all the new Harley 's ?
